Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Charles,

I am writing to you from a giant spaceship in a distant galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a white rocket in June. There are 11 apples and bananas of fruit here! In the
Kitchen there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a broken bed of
wood and dream of running fast. It feels as though I have lived here for One Year. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
by Driving on a Faster Car!!

Best wishes,
Ronaldo
